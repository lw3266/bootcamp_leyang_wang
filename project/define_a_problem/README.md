# Project Title
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Managing risk in futures trading, such as liquidity risk and basis risk.

## Stakeholder & User
 - Traders
 - Economists

## Useful Answer & Decision
The answer will be useful if it consists of concrete values that measures liquidity, or concrete comparison showing users the extent of the risk.

## Assumptions & Constraints
 - latency: free APIs may offer intra day quotes, but all of the them will be delayed by at least 15 minutes or more
 - availability: historical data might not be accessible, and certain trading data are costly
 - trustworthy: data is assumed to be error free

## Known Unknowns / Risks
 - whether analyzing past data indeed provide guidance to future risk avoidance
 - may require a broader scope of data (such as logistic or other indicators)

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
- Risk Analysis in Futures Trading → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Functional Tool to Support the Analysis

## Repo Plan
/data/, /src/, /notebooks/, /docs/ ; cadence for updates
